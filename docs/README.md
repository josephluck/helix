# Helix Documentation

Through the course of the documentation, you'll be introduced to the three main concepts in Helix.

Since Helix can be paired with many view libraries, we won't focus too much on views and components, although it'd be difficult to showcase Helix without it. We'll use [`yo-yo`](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo), which is a simple view library that uses [tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

We'll be discussing how we might build a simple [blog application](http://helix-blog.surge.sh) using Helix. Take a peek at the [source code](/examples/blog/src) as you follow the concepts.

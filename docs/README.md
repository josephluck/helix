# âš’ Helix

Helix provides provides an architecture that allows front-end developers to build robust, predictable, rich client side applications. Helix is a thin library that provides the glue between views, state and rendering.

Created by [Joseph Luck](http://www.josephluck.co.uk/) and the good folks at [Goodlord](http://www.goodlord.co).

# Omakase

Helix is made up of the following pieces:

- [Routing](https://josephluck.gitbooks.io/helix/Views/)
- [State management](https://josephluck.gitbooks.io/helix/Models/)
- [Rendering](https://josephluck.gitbooks.io/helix/Rendering/Rendering.html)

Helix supports rendering to any front-end UI framework, be it React, Vue, jQuery, or vanilla DOM and works really well with Typescript.

# Motivation

There's a plethora of front-end frameworks around each solving the same problem in a slightly different way. Helix solves the very same problems, but offers the following:

- Purely functional state, views and components
- 100% type safety when paired with Typescript
- Clean, concise API with minimal boilerplate
- Only a few, simple concepts to learn

# Purity

Helix is a built around functional programming concepts such as referential transparency and purity. This means that as a developer, you can be confident navigating, understanding and refactoring your code.

Since Helix can be paired with many view libraries, the documentation doesn't focus too much on the specifics of the HTML, although it'd be difficult to showcase Helix without it. The [`yo-yo`](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo) library will be used in the examples, which is a simple view library that uses [tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

Through the course of the documentation, the three main concepts; models, routes and rendering will be discussed in the context of a simple [blog application](http://helix-blog.surge.sh) using Helix. Take a peek at the [source code](http://github.com/josephluck/helix/tree/master/examples/blog) as you follow along.

# Example

A typical web application will have state, actions that can modify state and a user interface. Let's break it down into these three sections and combine them into a simple application:

### State

State can take any shape, but typically it's an object:

```javascript
const state = {
  posts: [
    'Learn Helix',
    'Profit'
  ]
}
```

### Actions

Actions make an application interactive: 

```javascript
const reducers = {
  addPost (state, post) {
    return { posts: [...state.posts, post] }
  }
}
```

### Interface

A user interface is essential for a web application. The interface both shows the user the current state of the application and provides a mechanism for the user to update the state of the application. We'll use the package `yo-yo` for the following example, but React, Inferno, Preact, Vue, jQuery etc are all supported.

```javascript
import * as html from 'yo-yo'
const component = (state, previousState, actions) => html`
  <div>
    ${state.posts.map(post => html`<span>${post}</span>`)}
    <button onclick=${e => actions.addPost('New Post')}>Add Post</button>
  </div>
`
```

### Altogether now

```javascript
import helix from 'helix-js'
import renderer from 'helix-js/src/renderers/yo-yo'

helix({
  model: {
    state: {
      posts: [
        'Learn Helix',
        'Profit'
      ]
    },
    reducers: {
      addPost (state, post) {
        return { posts: [...state.posts, post] }
      }
    },
  },
  component: (state, previousState, actions) => html`
    <div>
      ${state.posts.map(post => html`<span>${post}</span>`)}
      <button onclick=${e => actions.addPost('New Post')}>Add Post</button>
    </div>
  `,
  render: renderer(document.getElementById('root'))
})
```

Over the course of [the documentation](https://josephluck.gitbooks.io/helix), we'll showcase Helix's architecture by building a simple blog application.

# Helix Documentation

Through the course of the documentation, you'll be introduced to the three main concepts in Helix, models, routes and rendering.

Since Helix can be paired with many view libraries, we won't focus too much on the specifics of the HTML, although it'd be difficult to showcase Helix without it. We'll use [`yo-yo`](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo) for our examples, which is a simple view library that uses [tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

Throughout the course of the documentation, we'll be discussing how we might build a simple [blog application](http://helix-blog.surge.sh) using Helix. Take a peek at the [source code](http://github.com/josephluck/helix/tree/master/examples/blog) as you follow the concepts.

# Models

Models are at the heart of Twine. A model is defined as a combination of state and functions that either synchronously or asynchronously operate on state.

For our blog project, we'll be introducing a few key concepts, state, reducers, and effects as well as some more advanced concepts such as nested and scoped models.

# Views & Routing

Helix has out-of-the-box support for routing, but Helix can also be used in existing applications using the component option.

In this section we'll be pairing Helix with the [`yo-yo`](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo) library for simplicity, and we won't focus too much on the specifics of view libraries. We'll focus on the different types of view and some best practises.

# Views & Routing

Helix has out-of-the-box support for routing, but Helix can also be used in existing applications using the component option.

### Basic

* [Defining Routes](Routes.md)
* [Accessing State and Actions](State-And-Actions.md)

### Advanced

* [Lifecycle Hooks](Lifecycle-Hooks.md)
* [Layouts](Layouts.md)

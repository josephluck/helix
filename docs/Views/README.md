# Views & Routing

Helix has out-of-the-box support for routing, but Helix can also be used in existing applications using the component option.

In this section we'll be pairing Helix with the [`yo-yo`](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo) library for simplicity. We'll focus on the different types of view and some best practises instead of the `yo-yo` library itself. Head over to the [rendering](../Rendering/README.md) section if you want to learn more about pairing Helix with other view libraries.

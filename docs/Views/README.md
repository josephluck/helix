# Views & Routing

Helix has out-of-the-box support for routing, but Helix can also be used in existing applications using the component option.

In this section we'll be pairing Helix with the [`yo-yo`](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo) library for simplicity, and we won't focus too much on the specifics of view libraries. We'll focus on the different types of view and some best practises.

Let's dive in to the details.

### Basic

* [Accessing State and Actions](/docs/Views/State-And-Actions.md)

### Advanced

# Helix Documentation

Through the course of the documentation, you'll be introduced to the three main concepts in Helix:

- [Models](./Models.md)
- [Router](./Router.md)
- [Rendering](./Rendering.md)

Since Helix can be paired with many view libraries easily, we won't focus too much on views and components, although it'd be difficult to showcase Helix without it. The [`yo-yo`](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo) package will be used, which is a simple tagged template literal view library.

We'll be discussing how we might build a simple [blog application](http://helix-blog.surge.sh). Take a peek at the [source code](examples/blog/src) as you follow the concepts.
